# Mister Cardigan

This is the most wholesome website I could think of to make and it was prompted by requests from my kids to watch "the episode where Mister Rogers wears the green sweater."

Special thanks to [Rogers-Cardigans](https://github.com/Henryjean/Rogers-Cardigans) for the original dataset.

Episode descriptions were downloaded from [IMDb API](https://imdb-api.com/).
